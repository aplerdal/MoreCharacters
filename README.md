# Mario Kart: Super Circuit Asm Hack Template
In order for this to work you need a real mksc rom ripped from a cartridge. The included one is just an empty file and will not work.
You can read about gba assembly [here](https://gbadev.net/tonc/asm.html). For the specifics that you will need for asm *hacks* you can read about armips' syntax [here](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips/blob/master/Readme.md).
